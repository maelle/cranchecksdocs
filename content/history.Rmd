# History

Get link for compressed json file of historical CRAN checks results for a given date - across all packages.

On success, you'll get a 302 redirect, with a temporary link (expires in 15 minutes) for the Amazon S3 file in the Location response header.

Follow redirects to make sure that you are redirected to the link.

If you don't follow redirects, you'll get a JSON body telling you to redirect to the Location header link.

```{r results="asis"}
args <- c("https://cranchecks.info/history/2020-04-01")
get_and_show(args)
```
